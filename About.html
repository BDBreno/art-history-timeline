<h3 class="fontclass">Importance of Art</h3>
<p>
Studying art from the past is indeed very important for the historical and cultural view of a country. Without art, there wouldn't have been the Renaissance along with the rest of the artistic movements from the previous civilizations. Studying art from the past helps us understand the evolution of a country or why it changed when it did. Art helps a society evolve in its own way, which is why there are different styles of art in different countries. Without art, there wouldn't be any visual representations of the past, which means that people might have doubts because art can be reviewed as historical evidence for how people lived in the past.

<p>
We also can compare artwork, which provides different perspectives, and gives us a well-rounded way of looking at events, situations, and people. By analyzing artworks from the past and looking at their details, we can rewind time and experience what a time period different from our own was like.
