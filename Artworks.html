<h1>Important Historical Art</h1>

<br><br>

<p>Art is important to history because it provides us insight into events, beliefs, and values at specific moments in time. 
Art can communicate information, shape our everyday lives, make a social statement and be enjoyed for aesthetic beauty.
</p>
<p>Art History introduces you to cultural diversity.
you will also learn skills unique to art historians. You will learn to make visual arguments and, above all, you will train your eyes and brain in the skills of critical looking.
Art history provides a means by which we can understand our human past and its relationship to our present, because the act of making art is one of humanity’s most ubiquitous activities.

As an art historian you will learn about this rich and fundamental strand of human culture. You will learn to talk and write about works of art from different periods and places, in the same way that other students learn to write about literature or history. 
below are important artworks that greatly changed culture during its time.

  <figcaption>Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, c. 1517</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The subject’s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo’s skillful handling of sfumato, an artistic technique that uses subtle gradations of light and shadow to model form, and shows his understanding of the skull beneath the skin. The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric reveal Leonardo’s studied observations and inexhaustible patience. And, although the sitter’s steady gaze and restrained smile were not regarded as mysterious until the 19th century, viewers today can appreciate her equivocal expression. Leonardo painted a complex figure that is very much like a complicated human.

  <figcaption>Diego Velázquez's Las Meninas, c. 1656</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Spanish artist Diego Velázquez was the court painter for King Philip IV and known for his expressive portraits which captured the physical likeness and personality of his subjects. Las Meninas is his most revered work and still lauded by art historians today for its complex design. It shows the infanta Margaret Theresa surrounded by ladies in waiting, a chaperone, a bodyguard, a chamberlain, and even Velázquez himself.

  <figcaption>Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring, c. 1665</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Another of the most acclaimed paintings to emerge from this period is Johannes Vermeer's enticing portrait, Girl With a Pearl Earring. It portrays an anonymous woman wearing “exotic” blue-and-yellow clothing and sitting before a stark black background.
</p>
<p>
Girl with a Pearl Earring is sometimes nicknamed the “Mona Lisa of the North.” This is partially due to the subject's captivating expression, and because of the mystery surrounding the piece itself.

  <figcaption>Édouard Manet's Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe, c. 1863</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Manet's large-scale masterpiece, Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe (or The Luncheon on the Grass), bridges the gap between the Realist and Impressionist art movements with its modern approach to style and subject matter. Featuring a nude woman picnicking in the company of two well-dressed men, it derives inspiration from Classical paintings of female nudes while placing it in a contemporary setting.

  <figcaption>Claude Monet's Sunrise, c. 1874</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Impression, Sunrise depicts a hazy blue-hued seascape dotted with small boats and a bright orange sun. In fact, its radical use of expressive brushstrokes to portray a sunrise is what sparked the Impressionist art movement and named its creator, Claude Monet, the “Father of Impressionism.”
 The painting depicts the harbor of LeHavre in France, but Monet felt there wasn't enough detail to title the painting after the location. Therefore, the name Impression, Sunrise was given. Monet titled most of his paintings with “Impression” for this reason.

  <figcaption>Vincent van Gogh's Starry Night, c. 1889</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
While the Impressionist movement was preoccupied with portraying light in its painting, the Post-Impressionist movement focused on color. And few artists are as renowned for their use of color as Vincent van Gogh. The Starry Night was created late into the Dutch painter's short career and depicts the view from his window in the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.

  <img src="Historical%20Art/THE%20SCREAM.jpg" class="art" alt="The Scream">
  <figcaption>Edvard Munch's The Scream, c. 1893</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
One of the pioneers of Norwegian Expressionism, Edvard Munch‘s stylistic approach to conveying emotion, particularly feelings of anguish, is best displayed in his iconic masterpiece, The Scream.
This painting inspired the killer's mask in Wes Craven's movie franchise, Scream. The director said of the painting: “It's a classic reference to just the pure horror of parts of the 20th century, or perhaps just human existence.”
The Scream was not simply a product of stress, or an uncharacteristic moment of panic. It symbolizes the darkly troubled times Munch was experiencing as he dealt with mental illness and trauma, and his attempt to rationalize and explain his experience through what he knew best, painting.

</figure>
<p>
One of the world’s most famous contemporary artworks is artist Andy Warhol‘s Campbell’s Soup Cans. Symbolic of the Pop Art movement, the piece illustrates consumerist culture and mass media in American society. In addition to this, Warhol’s signature style is visible in his work. Through the repetition of the represented object, the artist reflects his critique of a consumerist society and its endless cycle of production and consumption.

  <img src="Historical%20Art/GUERNICA.jpg" class="art" alt="Guernica">
  <figcaption>Pablo Picasso's Guernica, c. 1937 </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Guernica is a town in northern Spain. On 26th April 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, Guernica was bombed by Nazi German and Fascist Italian warplanes on request of Spanish Nationalists. Picasso created this masterpiece in response to the bombing of Guernica. It brought worldwide attention to the Spanish Civil War and is considered one of the most powerful anti-war paintings in history. There have been numerous interpretations of Guernica since its creation. On the left of the canvas, a wide-eyed bull stands above a woman grieving over a dead child in her arms. The center is dominated by a horse falling in agony as if struck by a weapon. Under the horse is a dismembered soldier while towards its right is a frightened female figure which appears to have floated into the room through a window. From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center. The two dominant elements in the painting, the bull and the horse, are important characters in Spanish culture. Guernica is the most famous painting of modern art by arguably the greatest painter of all time.
