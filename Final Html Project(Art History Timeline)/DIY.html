<h3 class="centertext">Pop Art</h3>
<p>
the Pop Art movement aimed to blur the boundaries between "high" art and "low" culture. The concept that there is no hierarchy of culture and that art may borrow from any source has been one of the most influential characteristics of Pop Art.
</p>
<p>
The major themes of pop art is affluence, abundance and celebrity culture; is usually  drawn from advertising and consumerism with prominent brand names and recognizable packaging.

Pop art usually borrows from mass media. because fame and consumption is turned into inspriration and refence physically and aesthetically from visual sources such as television, magazines, and comic strips
</p>
<p>
Pop art showcases ordinary objects. This elevation of everyday objects to high art status subverted cultural hierarchy and commented on art’s role as a commodity. In doing so, artists like Andy Warhol elevated everyday objects to museum status.
Pop Art is, in many cases, removed of emotion, and it does this by removing material from its context. For example, a banana painted as part of a fruit bowl in a still life is quite different to this oversized banana by Andy Warhol.

<h3 class="centertext">Minimalism </h3>

<p>
Minimalism is considered an extension of abstract art, minimalism removes all essential forms in order to expose the purity and beauty of the art object. Minimalism does not have any centric compositions.
</p>

<p>
You can use letterforms for basic minimalism. They can be arranged into words and are valuable in minimalist compositions, where we aim to communicate with the least number of design elements possible. This can be done by making art of letters and giving them greater meaning or giving the impressions of words in the art piece to convey more meaning.
</p>

<p>
The most well known way to make minimalism is to reduce all objects in it to basic, geometric shapes. A combination of circles, squares and  triangles is common.

<h3 class="centertext">Realism</h3>
<p>
Realism refers to a mid nineteenth century artistic movement characterised by subjects painted from everyday life in a naturalistic manner. Realism has 8 main factors; precision, values, contrast, transitions, temperature, colors and saturation. These characteristics apply to any medium and will help your overall art. 
</p>
<p>
​1. Make sure you're using a quality reference - 
​Being able to discern between different values in your reference is absolutely key to you being able to recreate them. Make a mistake, value is much more important than color when creating realism. 
</p>
<p>
2. Know and prepare your art supplies - 
Using tools for the type of artwork you're intending to create is going to ensure that you're not making the process extra-difficult for yourself and you'll be able to progress much faster.
</p>
<p>
3. Always start with a light initial sketch, focusing on largest shapes first - 
The proportion and location of these different elements in regards to each other has to be spot on, before even thinking about moving on to things like shading and texture. 
</p>
<p>
4. Keep in mind that in realism, there are no visible lines - 
Realism uses many shades and values and harsh lines are just major contrasts in values. In real life, the shapes we see are created by subtle differences in values, which are influenced by light and shadow. These shapes are not outlined as they are in cartoons.
</p>
<p>
5. Create gradual, smooth transitions between your different values - 
Unless you're working with a photograph (or with a real-life composition) that shows very dramatic lighting, transitions between lights and darks must be gradual and smooth.
</p>
<p>
6. Make sure you are creating a very wide variety of values throughout your drawing - 
In order for your drawing to really pop out and transmit a sense of realistic three-dimensionality, you have to develop a huge range of values throughout your piece.
</p>
<p>
7. And lastly, practice - 
The best way to get better is consistency and goals. Setting goals for your art work and staying consistent. Even the worst people who can’t draw can learn with these basic techniques.
