<h1>Ancient Art History</h1>

<p>Ancient art was created around 30,000 B.C.E. to 400 A.D, the first opus of ancient art was bone flutes and sculptures and ended roughly near the fall of Rome. Many different styles of art were created over this long period. Ancient art is important because it gives context and shows historians the culture, values and beliefs of these early civilizations.

<h3 class="centertext">Stone Age Art (30,000 BCE to about 3,000 BCE)</h3>

<p>
The Stone Age has been divided into three periods the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic. The art of the Stone Age represents the first accomplishments in human creativity, preceding the invention of writing. While numerous artifacts still exist today, the lack of writing systems from this era greatly limits our understanding of prehistoric art and culture.

<p>The 
Paleolithic small sculptures are made of clay, bone, ivory, or stone and consist of simple figurines depicting animals and humans. In particular, Venus figurines are the most indicative of this era. They are highly stylized depictions of women with exaggerated female parts representing fertility and sexuality. They typically date to the Gravettian period (26,000–21,000 years ago), but the earliest known Venus figurine (Venus of Hohle Fels) dates to at least 35,000 years ago, and the most recent (Venus of Monruz) dates to roughly 11,000 years ago. They are most common in the Mediterranean region, but there are examples from as far as Siberia. Archaeologists can only speculate on their meaning, but their ubiquitous nature indicates a universal human attraction to art and possibly religion.
</p>

<p>
From the Paleolithic through the Mesolithic, cave paintings and portable art such as figurines, statuettes, and beads predominated, with decorative figured workings also seen on some utilitarian objects. Venus figurines—an umbrella term for a number of prehistoric female statuettes portrayed with similar physical attributes—were very popular at the time. These figurines were carved from soft stone (such as steatite , calcite, or limestone), bone or ivory, or formed of clay and fired. The latter are among the oldest ceramics known. Also in this period, personal accessories and adornments were made from shell and bone. All the examples mentioned above fall under the category of portable art: small for easy transport.

The Neolithic saw the transformation of nomad human settlements into agrarian societies in need of permanent shelter. From this period there is evidence of early pottery, as well as sculpture, architecture, and the construction of megaliths . Early rock art also first appeared in the Neolithic period. The advent of metal workings was the beging of the bronzes age.

<h3 class="centertext">Bronze Age Art (c.3000-1200 BCE)</h3>

<p>
The best examples of Bronze Age art appeared in the 'cradle of civilization' around the Mediterranean in the Near East, during the rise of Mesopotamia - see Sumerian Art and Mesopotamian art as well as Mesopotamian sculpture - Greece, Crete (Minoan civilization) and Egypt. The emergence of cities, the use of written languages and the development of more sophisticated tools led the creation of a wider range of ceramics. Other Bronze Age art included statues, sculptures and paintings of Gods. During this period, art began to assume a significant role in reflecting the community, its rulers and its relationship with the deities it worshipped. For other cultures of the Middle East, see: Assyrian art (c.1500-612 BCE) and Hittite art (c.1600-1180 BCE).

Ancient Egypt is most famous for its monumental Egyptian Architecture (c.3000 BCE - 160 CE), and its associated Egyptian sculpture. It is also the first civilization with a recognizable style of art. In paintings, artists depicted the head, legs and feet of their human subjects in profile, while portraying the eye, shoulders, arms and torso from the front. Other conventions dictated how Gods, Pharaohs and ordinary people should be portrayed, and regulated the size, colour and figurative positions of these images accordingly. Women were painted with fair skin, men with dark skin. Much of Egyptian art in tombs and temples (hieroglyphs, papyrus scrolls, murals, panel paintings and sculptures) reflects religious themes, especially those concerning the afterlife. In modern times, a number of outstanding Egyptian encaustic wax paintings, known as the Fayum Mummy portraits, dating from 50 CE, have been found preserved in coffins. These pictures offer a fascinating glimpse into the styles, customs and culture of the day.

<p>
The first major strand of Aegean Art - Minoan civilization (named after King Minos) - grew up during the bronze age on the island of Crete. By 2100 BCE they had built up a prosperous maritime trade with countries around the Mediterranean from buying tin and combining it with copper from Cyprus, to make bronze - the key metal of the time. This prosperity led to the construction of palaces and court buildings at Knossos, Phaestus, Akrotiri, Kato Zakros and Mallia, along with other public buildings. Thus emerged a Minoan art and culture noted for its sculpture, metalwork, fresco painting, pottery, and stone engravings (particularly seal stones).

<h3 class="centertext">Iron Age Art (c.1500-200 BCE)</h3>

<p>
The Iron Age saw a huge growth in artistic activity, especially in Greece and around the eastern Mediterranean. It coincided with the rise of Hellenic (Greek-influenced) culture.
The period is typically classified into several smaller periods: the Dark Ages (c.1200-900 BCE), the Geometric Period (c.900-700 BCE), Oriental-Style Period (c.700-625 BCE), the Archaic Period (c.625-500 BCE), the Classical Period (c.500-323 BCE), and the Hellenistic Period (c.323-100 BCE).

<p>
Mycenae was an ancient Greek city in the Peloponnese. But the term "Mycenaean" or "Mycenean" culture commonly denotes mainland Greek culture as a whole during the late Bronze Age (c.1650-1200 BCE). At first, Mycenean/Greek arts were dominated by Minoan culture. Minoan artists and painters visited Greece regularly. In contrast to the Minoans, Mycenean kings were warriors with a tradition of conquest. Mycenean painters and sculptors emphasized military and other mythological exploits, in a more formal 'geometric' style than that of the Minoans. Mycenean art encompassed ceramics, pottery, carved gemstones, jewellery, glass ornaments, as well as tomb and palace murals, frescoes and sculptures.

By around 1100 BCE, the Celts, an Indo-European group of tribes had established themselves in a controlling position astride the main trade routes along the river systems of the Rhone, Seine, Rhine and Danube. Between 1100 and 700 BCE, they were the first non-Mediterranean people to develop iron which gave them the technological superiority to colonize their neighbours throughout France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, Slovakia. Two styles of Iron Age Celtic art emerged: Hallstatt and La Tene. The more advanced La Tene form of Celtic culture was characterized by its distinctive geometric designs and stylized bird and animal forms, as exemplified by the decorative designs on the stonework of the Turoe Stone, one of the earliest examples of visual art in Ireland. Celtic metalwork also achieved an extremely high standard of craftsmanship, as exemplified by the Irish Petrie Crown and Broighter Collar. La Tene style Celtic Designs were strongly influenced by the Mediterranean culture of the Greek and Etruscan civilizations and continued to flourish until the advent of the Roman Empire.

Before the beginning of the sixth century BCE, there is Archaic Greek painting, and Archaic Style Greek Sculpture. From 500 BCE, Athens was the strongest of the Greek city states, a position it maintained for the next few centuries. During the 5th century BCE, Greece witnessed a creative Renaissance - exemplified by the architecture and sculpture of the Parthenon - which, when rediscovered by Renaissance Europe 2000 years later, became the absolute artistic standard for another four centuries. Most original Greek architecture, painting and Greek sculpture have been destroyed, but its genius survives through Roman copies and Greek Pottery. Among the foremost sculptors were Polykleitos, Myron, and Phidias. Polykleitos, in particular, was renowned for his mastery of contrapposto. Classical Greek painting is rather scarce, sculpture less so, which is why art historians tend to subdivide sculptures from this era into early classical, high classical and late classical. period. The Greek grasp of linear perspective and naturalist representation remained unsurpassed until the Italian Renaissance.

<p>
During the era of Hellenistic art, classical realism was replaced with greater solemnity and heroicism, an almost Baroque-like dramatization of subject matter. The principal art-forms were Hellenistic painting, Hellenistic free-standing sculpture and reliefs. Famous examples of Greek sculpture include: "Dying Gaul" (c.232 BCE) by Epigonus; the frieze "Altar of Zeus" at Pergamum(c.180 BCE); "Aphrodite, Pan and Eros" (c.100 BCE); the "Winged Victory of Samothrace" (c.1st/2nd century BCE), now in the Louvre; "Laocoon and His Sons" by Hagesandrus, Polydorus and Athenodorus (c.40-31 BCE). The famous marble statue known as the "Venus de Milo", now in the Louvre Museum, Paris, was completed around 100 BCE. During this period, new forms secular patrons of the visual arts emerged who influenced the choice of subject matter in sculpture, painting and mosaics. Meanwhile, the rise of Roman power caused many Greek artists to move to Italy to participate in the growing Roman art market. In Egypt, the most famous example of Hellenistic painting was the Fayum Mummy portraits, unearthed mainly west of the Nile in the Faiyum Basin.

China was also becoming more artistically active at this time. See for instance the Chinese collection of terracotta sculpture, known as the Terracotta Army, created during the era of Qin Dynasty art (221-206 BCE), as well as other forms of Chinese art like the highly regarded medium of Calligraphy. See also Indian Sculpture (3300 BCE - 1850) and Classical Indian Painting (Up to 1150 CE).

<p>Roman architecture and engineering was always grandiose, but its paintings and sculptures remained largely imitative of Greek art. Greek styles, reworked with Roman clothes and accessories, were used to reinforce Rome's power and majesty. Early Roman art (c.200-27 BCE) was realistic and direct. Portraits of their leaders were detailed and unidealized, but they, along with sculptural reliefs, friezes and wall paintings, were used nevertheless to convey political messages through the poses and subject matter. Later Hellenistic Roman art (c.27 BCE - 200 CE) during the height of Empire, was more heroic, as in Trajan's Column (c.106-113 CE). Decorative arts flourished throughout the Roman area, largely through a proliferation of murals. Panel painting was regarded more highly, being executed in tempera or in encaustic pigments. Roman sculpture was commissioned mainly for its visual effect on the public. The underlying message of Roman greatness was rarely far from the surface. Late Roman art (200-400 CE) came under the influence of the Eastern Roman Empire in Constantinople, and also during this period we ssee the emergence of both Celtic Roman art and Christian Roman art.
