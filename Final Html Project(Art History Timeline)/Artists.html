<h1>Important Artists</h1>

<br>

<p>
Artists work to illuminate the margins and make societal changes. Rather than the word "role", I prefer "commitment". Art can communicate information, shape our everyday lives, make a social statement and be enjoyed for aesthetic beauty.
Art influences society by changing opinions, instilling values and translating experiences across space and time. it allows people from different cultures and different times to communicate with each other via images, sounds and stories. Art is often a vehicle for social change.

<p>
The original Renaissance Man, Leonardo is identified with genius, not only for masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa (the title for which has entered the language as a superlative), The Last Supper and The Lady with an Ermine, but also for his drawings of technologies (aircraft, tanks, automobile) that were five hundred years in the future.

  <figcaption>Johannes Vermeer, Baroque</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Remarkably, Vermeer was largely forgotten for two centuries before his rediscovery in the 19th century. Since then, he’s been recognized as one of art history’s most important figures, an artist capable of rendering works of uncanny beauty. Many have argued the Vermeer used a camera obscura—an early form of projector—and certainly the soft blur he employs appears to foreshadow photorealism. But the most important aspect of his work is how it represents light as a tangible substance.

</figure>
<p>
Perhaps the best know artist among the Impressionists, Monet captured the changeable effects of light on the landscape through prismatic shards of color delivered as rapidly painted strokes. Moreover, his multiple studies of haystacks and other subjects anticipated the use of serial imagery in Pop Art and Minimalism. But the same token, his magisterial, late-career lily pond paintings foreshadowed Abstract Expressionism and Color-Field Abstaction.

  <figcaption>Gustave Courbet, Realism </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Gustave Courbet was the undisputed leader of Realism and the key figure responsible for the rise of the movement. He rejected the predominant Romantic and Neoclassical schools prevalent in Europe and instead shocked the art world through bold images which challenged the boundaries of what was acceptable. He depicted non-idealized peasants and workers on a grand scale reserved for religious or historical subjects; undertook subjects which were considered vulgar; addressed social issues in his art; and even painted a close-up view of the genitals and abdomen of a naked woman. Called a genius, a “terrible socialist” and a “savage” during his time, Gustave Courbet is now considered one of the most important artists who not only led a prominent movement but also widely influenced future generation of artists.

<p>
My personal favorite Pop artist is Roy Lichtenstein, his reuse of advertisements and bold paintings of everyday objects reflected american society and consumerism. his skill impact on the art world and general society made him one of the leaders of the Pop art movement, he was only surpassed by . Born Andrew Warhola, Andy Warhol is the best known and most influential artist of the Pop Art movement to the extent that he is known as the “Pope of Pop”. The non-painterly style and commercial aspects of his paintings initially caused offense as it affronted the technique and philosophy of abstract expressionism, the then dominant style in the United States. His works created an uproar in the American art world and the resulting controversy made Warhol a household name. Warhol was a prolific artist and he explored a wide variety of media including painting, silkscreening, photography, film and sculpture. His paintings are among the most expensive ever sold. The highest price paid for a Warhol painting is US$105 million for a 1963 canvas titled Silver Car Crash while, if one adjusts for inflation, his most expensive painting is Eight Elvises at US$111.2. Andy Warhol is without doubt the most famous Pop Artist.

  <figcaption>Sol LeWitt, Minimalism </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lewitt is often credited with establishing a solid link between minimalism and conceptual art. In Wall Drawing 439, Lewitt’s use of color and triangle shapes on a flat plane lends itself to a more complete and three-dimensional form for the viewer.

He also did not focus on authorship because for many of his works he provided his assistants or the museum with a set of instructions that were vague and were open to interpretation. This was on purpose because LeWitt focused on that the idea was the work, and the person that executes the work does that matter. To LeWitt, it did not matter that the wall drawing could be painted over by the museum, but that the idea inside his mind could be interpreted in so many different ways and it was his original idea that was the work. He believed that there should be no narrative for his work, rather than having a work with a specific message, art could just exist. Meaning in not required in art. 

He is one of the most popular avant-garde American sculptors and one of most highly respected postmodernist artists of his generation.

  <figcaption>Jacques-Louis David, Neoclassical </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Jacques-Louis David was a 19th-century painter who is considered to be the principal proponent of the Neoclassical style. His most famous works include "The Death of Marat" and "Napoleon Crossing the Alps."
When the French Revolution began in 1789, he served briefly as its artistic director and painted its leaders and martyrs (The Death of Marat, 1793) in a style that is more realistic than classical.
These challenges to the primacy of David's Neoclassical style set the stage for a radical redefinition of history painting around 1800 in France.
