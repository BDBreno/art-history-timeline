<h1>Medieval Art History</h1>

<br>

<p>
Medieval art covers a vast scope of over 1000 years of art in Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa. It includes major art movements and periods, national and regional art and the artists themselves.
Medieval time periods encapsulates phases of Early Christian, Romanesque, Gothic art and many other styles relevant at the time. This was mostly during the time when many nations and cultures started to cultivate their own distinct artistic style, such as Anglo-Saxon art or Viking art.

<h3 class="centertext">Paleo-Christian Art (200 - 500)</h3>

<img src="Medieval%20Art/Christian%20art.jpg" alt="christian art" width="90" height="100" style="float:right;">

<p>
Paleo or early Christian art, architecture, painting, and sculpture began about the early 6th century, particularly the art of Italy and the western Mediterranean. Early Christian art in the eastern part of the Roman Empire is usually considered to be part of Byzantine art. The Christian religion was part of a general trend in the late Roman Empire toward mysticism and spirituality. As Christianity developed, its art reflected the prevailing late antique artistic climate. Except for differences in subject matter, Christian and pagan works looked much the same. The onset of Byzantine style was in 500 and took over early Christian art. 
</p>

<h3 class="centertext">Byzantine Art (537 - 1453)</h3>

<p>
Byzantine art started in 330 to 1453. The term Byzantine is derived from the Byzantine Empire, which developed from the Roman Empire. In 330 the Roman Emperor Constantine established the city of Byzantion in modern day Turkey as the new capital of the Roman empire and renamed it Constantinople. In 1555 the German historian Hieronymus Wolf first used the term Byzantine Empire in Corpus Historiæ Byzantinæ, his collection of the era's historical documents. The term became popularized among French scholars in the 17th century with the publication of the Byzantine du Louvre (1648) and Historia Byzantina (1680). Byzantine architecture and art in mosaics, icon painting, frescos, illuminated manuscripts, small scale sculptures and enamel work, was defined.
</p>

<h3 class="centertext">Early Byzantine Art (537 - 843)</h3>

<img src="Medieval%20Art/Early%20Byzantine%20Art.jpg" alt="early byzantine art" width="200" height="150" style="float:right;">

<p>
The beginning of Byzantine architecture and art occurred in the reign of the Emperor Justinian from 527-565, as he embarked on a building campaign in Constantinople, Ravenna and Italy. His most notable monument was Hagia Sophia, an immense church with a massive dome and light filled interior. The Hagia Sophia's many windows, colored marble, bright mosaics, and gold highlights became the standard models for subsequent Byzantine architecture. Over 10,000 artisans built and decorated the Hagia Sophia. Justinian's reign, Byzantine art and architecture influenced modern day Turkey, Greece, the Adriatic regions of Italy, the Middle East, Spain, Northern Africa, and Eastern Europe. While other structures, particularly his Chrysotriklinos, the imperial palace reception room, were equally influential, that building, like other early structures in Constantinople, was later destroyed. As a result, the best examples of Early Byzantine innovation can be seen in Ravenna, Italy.
</p>

<p>
The early era came to an end with a change in imperial power. Following the death of Emperor Theophilus, in 842, the Empress Theodora took the throne and, as she was passionately devoted to the veneration of icons, summoned a council that restored icon worship and deposed the iconoclastic clergy. Iconoclastic Controversy was when the Byzantine Empire used religious images and icons that were opposed by religious and imperial authorities within the Orthodox Church and the temporal imperial hierarchy 726 - 842. This had a notable impact on the later development of art, as the councils that restored the worship of icons also formulated a codified system of symbols and iconographic (the study of identification, description and interpretation of historical content of images) types that were also followed in mosaics and fresco painting.
</p>

<h3 class="centertext">Middle Byzantine Art (867 - 1204)</h3>

<img src="Medieval%20Art/Middle%20Byzantine%20Art.jpg" alt="middle byzantine art" width="200" height="100" style="float:left;">

<p>
The Middle Byzantine era is often called the Macedonian Renaissance, as Basil I the Macedonian, crowned in 867, reopened the universities and promoted literature and art, renewing an interest in classical Greek scholarship and aesthetics. Macedonian Renaissance is known for the blossoming of Byzantine culture in the 9th–11th centuries, under the eponymous Macedonian dynasty and is also called Byzantine encyclopedism.
</p>

<p>
Photios I of Constantinople a Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople  has been described by the historian Adrian Forescue as "the greatest scholar of his time." His Bibliotheca was an important compilation of almost three hundred works by classical authors, and he played a leading role in seeing Byzantine culture as rooted in Greek culture. He collected traditions of classical art from years and eras ago that art was influential to The Paris Psalter is a Byzantine illuminated manuscript, a book of biblical psalms.
</p>

<p>
Byzantine culture and art was seen as the height of aesthetic refinement, and, as a result, many rulers, even those politically antagonistic to the Empire, employed Byzantine artists. the first Norman King, recruited Byzantine artists and, as a result, the Norman architecture that developed in Sicily and Great Britain, following the Norman Conquest in 1066, profoundly influenced Gothic architecture. Hundreds of Byzantine artists were also employed at the Basilica of San Marco in Venice when construction began in 1063. In Russia, Vladimir of Kiev converted to the Orthodox Church upon his marriage to a Byzantine princess. He employed artists from Constantinople at the St. Sophia's Cathedral he built in Kiev in 1307. Notable examples of Macedonian Renaissance art were also created in Greece, while the influx of Byzantine artists influenced art throughout Western Europe as shown by the Italian artist Berlinghiero of Lucca's Hodegetria (c. 1230).
</p>

<h3 class="centertext">The Latin Occupation (1204 - 1261)</h3>

<p>
Constantinople was cruelly sacked and the Empire conquered in 1204 by the Crusade Army and Venetian forces under the Fourth Crusade. The brutal attack upon a Christian city and its inhabitants was unprecedented, and historians view it as a turning point in medieval history
weakening the Byzantine Empire and contributing to its later demise when conquered by the Turkish Ottoman Empire. Many notable artworks and sacred objects were looted, destroyed, or lost. Some works, like the Roman bronze works of the Hippodrome, were carried off to Venice where they are still on display, while other works, including sacred objects and altars as well as classical bronze statues, were melted down, and the Library of Constantinople was destroyed. Though the Latins were driven out by 1261, Byzantium never recovered its former glory or power.
</p>

<h3 class="centertext">Late Byzantium Art (1261 - 1453)</h3>


<img src="Medieval%20Art/Late%20Byzantium%20Art.jpg" alt="late byzantine art" width="200" height="115" style="float:left;">

<p>
the Late Byzantine era began to renovate and restore Orthodox churches. However, as the Conquest had decimated the economy and left much of the city in ruins, artists employed more economical materials, and miniature mosaic icons became popular. In icon painting, the suffering of the population during the Conquest led to an emphasis upon images of compassion, as shown in sufferings of Christ. Artistic vitality shifted to Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Greece, where regional variations of icon painting developed. Russia became a leading center with the Novgorod School of Icon Painting, led by master painters Theophanes the Greek and Andrei Rublev. Byzantine art also influenced contemporaneous art in the West, particularly the Sienese School of Painting and the International Gothic Style, as well as painters like Duccio in his Stroganoff Madonna (1300).

<h3 class="centertext">Migration Period (700 – 900)</h3>

<img src="Medieval%20Art/MigrationArt.jpg" alt="Migration art" width="700" height="100" style="float:right;">

<p>
Migration Period art describes the art of the "barbarian" Germanic and Eastern-European peoples who were on the move, and then settling within the former Roman Empire
the blanket term covers a wide range of ethnic or regional styles including early Anglo-Saxon art, Visigothic art, Viking art, and Merovingian art, all of which made use of the animal style as well as geometric motifs derived from classical art. By this period the animal style had reached a much more abstracted form than in earlier Scythian art or La Tène style. Most artworks were small and portable and those surviving are mostly jewellery and metalwork, with the art expressed in geometric or schematic designs, often beautifully conceived and made, with few human figures and no attempt at realism. 
As the "barbarian" peoples were Christianized, these influences interacted with the post-classical Mediterranean Christian artistic tradition, and new forms like the illuminated manuscript
</p>

<p>
Larger works like Anglo-Saxon wooden pagan statues are all now lost, but the in Norse art the tradition of carved runestones was maintained after their conversion to Christianity. The Celtic Picts of Scotland also carved stones before and after conversion, and the distinctive Anglo-Saxon and Irish tradition of large outdoor carved crosses may reflect earlier pagan works. Viking art from later centuries in Scandinavia and parts of the British Isles includes work from both pagan and Christian backgrounds, and was one of the last flowerings of this broad group of styles.
</p>

<hr>

<h3 class="centertext">Insular Art (500 - 900)</h3>

<p>
Insular art refers to the distinct style found in Ireland and Britain from about the 5th century, to about the 10th century, lasting lastly in Ireland, and parts of Scotland. The style saw a fusion between the traditions of Celtic art, the Germanic Migration period art of the Anglo-Saxons and the Christian forms.
</p>

<p>
Insular art is extremely detailed in geometric, interlace, and stylised animal decoration, with forms derived from secular metalwork like brooches, spread boldly across manuscripts. The insular manuscript style was transmitted to the continent by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, and its anti-classical energy was extremely important in the formation of later medieval styles. In most Late Antique manuscripts text and decoration were kept clearly apart, though some initials began to be enlarged and elaborated, but major insular manuscripts sometimes take a whole page for a single initial or the first few words. Allowing decoration a "right to roam" was to be very influential on Romanesque and Gothic art in all media. "Franco-Saxon" is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. Continued until as late as the 11th century.
</p>

<hr>

<h3 class="centertext">Romanesque Art (1000 - 1200)</h3>

<p>
Romanesque art developed in the period between about 1000 to the rise of Gothic art in the 12th century, in conjunction with the rise of monasticism (monkhood) in Western Europe. Developed initially in France, but spread to Christian Spain, England, Flanders, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere to become the first medieval style found all over Europe, though with regional differences. Romanesque architecture is dominated by thick walls, massive structures conceived as a single organic form, with vaulted roofs and round-headed windows and arches.
</p>

<p>
Typology became the dominant approach in theological literature and art to interpreting the bible, art has always influenced the bible and this period, juxtaposing Old and New Testament and  aspects of the life of Christ. Often the art is based in tradition, at the time of this period the New Testament and models originating in Late Antiquity. 
</p>

<img src="Medieval%20Art/Romanesque%20glass.jpg" alt="Romanesque glass art" width="200" height="115" style="float:right;">

<p>
Stained glass became a significant art-form in the period, though little Romanesque glass survives. The bible became a new focus of intensive decoration, with the psalter also remaining important and could be seen in many of the churches at the time with a strong emphasis on the suffering of Christ and other sacred figures entered Western art. The end of the Romanesque period saw the start of the greatly increased emphasis on the Virgin Mary in theology, literature and so also art that was to reach its full extent in the Gothic period.
</p>

<h3 class="centertext">Gothic  Art (1100 - 1400)</h3>

<p>
The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is very imprecise and not at all a clear break. Gothic art was a style of medieval art that developed in Northern France, heavily influenced from Romanesque art, led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture. Gothic art was led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture which came 50 years before gothic paintings, spreading to all of Western Europe, most of Northern, Southern and Central Europe. Painting during the Gothic period was practiced in four primary media: frescos, panel paintings, manuscript illumination and stained glass.

</p>

<p>
The earliest Gothic art was monumental sculpture, on the walls of Cathedrals and abbeys. Christian art was often typological in nature as most art was at this time, showing the stories of the New and Old Testament side by side and Saints’ lives. Gothic architect Hugues Libergier first began developing the style in the Abbey church of Saint Nicaise in Reims, France around 1231.

</p>

<p>
Secular art (art with no religious notion) began blooming this period with the rise of cities, foundation of universities, increase in trade, the establishment of a money-based economy and the creation of a bourgeois class who could afford to patronize the arts and commission works, resulting in a proliferation of paintings and illuminated manuscripts. Increased literacy and a growing body of secular vernacular literature encouraged the representation of secular themes in art. With the growth of cities, trade guilds were formed and artists were often required to be members of a painters' guild. As a result, because of better record keeping, more artists are known to us by name in this period than any previous; some artists were even so bold as to sign their names.

</p>

<p>
The word "Gothic" for art was initially used as a synonym for "Barbaric", and was therefore used pejoratively. This type of Medieval art was unrefined and too remote from the aesthetic proportions and shapes of Classical art. In the 15th century, various Italian architects and writers complained that the new "barbarian" styles were filtering down from north of the Alps. The "Gothic" qualifier for this art was first used in Raphael's letter to Pope Leo X c. 1518 and was subsequently popularised by the Italian artist and writer Giorgio Vasari, who used it as early as 1530, calling Gothic art a "monstrous and barbarous" "disorder". "Gothic art" was strongly criticized by French authors such as Boileau, La Bruyère, Rousseau, before becoming a recognized form of art. In its beginning, Gothic art was initially called "French work" (Opus Francigenum), thus attesting the priority of France in the creation of this style.

</p>

<h3 class="centertext">High Gothic  Art (1194 – 1250)</h3>

<img src="Medieval%20Art/rayonnant%20gothic%20architecture.jpg" alt="Gothic architecture" width="200" height="150" style="float:right;">
<p>
The second phase of Gothic architecture began with a subdivision of the style known as Rayonnant (1200–80) on the Continent and as the Decorated Gothic (1300–75) style in England. This style was characterized by the application of increasingly elaborate geometrical decoration to the structural forms that had been established during the preceding century During the period of the Rayonnant style a significant change took place in Gothic architecture. Until about 1250, Gothic architects concentrated on the harmonious distribution of masses of masonry and became more concerned with the creation of rich visual effects through decoration. The most characteristic and finest achievement of the Rayonnant style is the great circular rose window adorning the west facades of large French cathedrals; the typically radial patterns of the tracery inspired the designation Rayonnant for the new style. The most notable examples of the Rayonnant style are the cathedrals of Reims, Amiens, Bourges, Chartres, and Beauvais.

</p>

<p>
Illuminated manuscripts represent the most complete record of Gothic painting, providing a record of styles in places where no monumental works have otherwise survived. The earliest full manuscripts with French Gothic illustrations date to the middle of the 13th century.

</p>

<p>
In northern Europe, stained glass was an important and prestigious form of painting until the 15th century. Gothic architecture greatly increased the amount of glass in large buildings, partly to allow for wide expanses of glass, as in rose windows. In the early part of the period mainly black paint and clear or brightly coloured glass was used, but in the early 14th century the use of compounds of silver, painted on glass which was then fired, allowed a number of variations of colour. By the end of the period designs increasingly used large pieces of glass which were painted, with yellows as the dominant colours, and relatively few smaller pieces of glass in other colours.

</p>

<h3 class="centertext">Late Gothic Phase Art (1280 - 1500)</h3>

<p>
the Flamboyant style, which lasted until about 1500. In England a development known as the Perpendicular style lasted from about 1375 to 1500. The most conspicuous feature of the Flamboyant Gothic style is the dominance in stone window tracery of a flamelike S-shaped curve. Structural logic was obscured by the virtual covering of the exteriors of buildings with tracery, which often decorated masonry as well as windows. A profusion of pinnacles, gables, and other details such as subsidiary ribs in the vaults to form star patterns further complicated the total effect.

</p>

<img src="Medieval%20Art/late%20Gothic%20painting.jpg" alt="late gothic art" width="200" height="100" style="float:right;">

<p>
In late Gothic painting of the 14th and 15th centuries secular subjects such as hunting scenes, chivalric themes, and depictions of historical events also appeared. Religious and secular subjects were depicted in manuscript illuminations and pictorial embellishment of handwritten books. This was a major form of artistic production during the Gothic period and reached its peak in France during the 14th century. The calendar illustrations in the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (c. 1409–16) by the Limbourg brothers, who worked at the court of Jean de France, duc de Berry, are perhaps the most eloquent statements of the International Gothic style as well as the best known of all manuscript illuminations.

</p>

<p>
Manuscript illumination was superseded by printed illustrations in the second half of the 15th century. Panel and wall painting evolved gradually into the Renaissance style in Italy during the 14th and early 15th centuries but retained many more of its Gothic characteristics until the late 15th and early 16th centuries in Germany, Flanders, and elsewhere in Northern Europe.
