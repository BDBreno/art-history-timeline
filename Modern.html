<h1>Modern Art History</h1>

<br>

<p>
modern art, painting, sculpture, architecture, and graphic arts characteristic of the 20th and 21st centuries and of the later part of the 19th century. Modern art embraces a wide variety of movements, theories, and attitudes whose modernism resides particularly in a tendency to reject traditional, historical, or academic forms and conventions in an effort to create an art more in keeping with changed social, economic, and intellectual conditions. Modern art plays an essential role as a stimulus that can provoke independent thoughts and even emotions. Modern art gives the audience an opportunity to embrace new ideas and reflect on changes in the world and our lives differently.

<h3 class="centertext">Impressionism (1860 - 1890)</h3>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Le%20déjeuner%20sur%20l'herbe.jpg" class="artt" alt="Le déjeuner sur l'herbe" style="float:right;width:128px;height:128px;">

<p>
The date perhaps most commonly identified as marking the birth of modern art is 1863, the year that Édouard Manet showed his painting Le déjeuner sur l'herbe in the Salon des Refusés in Paris. The Impressionists searched for a more exact analysis of the effects of color and light in nature. They sought to capture the atmosphere of a particular time of day or the effects of different weather conditions. They often worked outdoors and applied their paint in small brightly colored strokes which meant sacrificing much of the outline and detail of their subject. Impressionism abandoned the conventional idea that the shadow of an object was made up from its color with some brown or black added. Instead, the Impressionists enriched their colors with the idea that a shadow is broken up with dashes of its complementary color.
</p>

<p>
American John Rand designed in 1841 a device that would revolutionize the art world: paint in a tube. His clever new technology offered easily portable, pre-mixed paint, and allowed painters to bring their process outdoors. Rand’s technological leap allowed spontaneity and a casual quality to the work of Impressionists. Over time, other artists joined in the practice, and their exploration together moved from indoor studios to outdoor cafes, with regular get-togethers to discuss their ideas.
</p>

<p>
Claude Monet was a leader of the movement, and his brief brush strokes and fragmented color application found their way into the works of others. He was particularly interested in the passage of time in his portrayal of light. His series of paintings capturing Rouen Cathedral at different times of the year and day offer clear examples of Monet’s ideas on how a subject can be transformed by properties around it. His most famous of this series is 1894’s Rouen Cathedral: The Facade at Sunset. Monet expanded his Impressionist practice throughout his life, culminating in his multiple studies of the Waterlily Pond.
</p>

<p>
Most experts agree that the impressionist period began in 1860, when the impressionists started to meet and take painting classes in Paris. The end of the impressionist era is more difficult to pinpoint. The death of Edouard Manet in 1883 and the final impressionist exhibition was held in 1886. The Impressionist era died until finally the death of Claude Monet in 1926. Monet was the last impressionist to pass. 
</p>

<p>
Paul Durand-Ruel, the Impressionists’ principal dealer, was also struggling financially during this period. Despite a series of one-man shows, Durand-Ruel had been unable to breathe life into the French market for Impressionist art. By the mid-1880s, his business was in serious danger of going under, which spelled disaster for many of the artists who relied on him for financial support. Insecurity turned to bitterness and many of the Impressionist artists began to turn on one another. The resentment surrounding middle age and the successes of the new generation of artists served to heighten weaknesses that already existed within the group. The air of discontent that had been building since before the final Impressionist exhibition reached a tipping point in the 1880s and the artists gradually withdrew into separate camps.

<h3 class="centertext"> Symbolism (1886 - 1900)</h3>

<p>
Symbolism was a late 19th-century art movement of French, Russian and Belgian origin in poetry and other arts seeking to represent absolute truths symbolically through language and metaphorical images, mainly as a reaction against naturalism and realism.
</p>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Symbolism.jpg" class="artt" alt="Symbolism" style="float:right;width:130px;height:150px;">

<p>
Symbolist painters and sculptors were inspired by literature and poetry of the day, as well as the history, legends, myths, Biblical stories and fables of the past. In expressing themselves, symbolist artists endowed their subjects (women, heroic males, flowers, landscapes, animals), with mythological or other esoteric meanings. As a result of this desire for an artistic refuge, the symbolists used characteristic themes of mysticism and otherworldliness and keen sense of mortality. Stéphane Mallarmé's poem Les fenêtres expresses all of these themes clearly. Many artists turned to stimulants like alcohol and drugs to fuel their imagination. Favourite symbolist subjects included: sensual issues, religious feelings, occultism, love, death, disease and sin, while decadence was a common feature.
</p>

<p>
Symbolism was in many ways a reaction against the soulless urbanization and materialism of the Victorian Age. It rejected the narrow representational confines of Naturalism, preferring to roam the wider fields of mysticism, idealism, romanticism and obscurantism. Philosophically, it sought the deeper truths which lay beneath the Naturalist or Impressionist surface.
</p>

<p>
The Symbolist movement in poetry reached its peak around 1890 and began to enter a precipitous decline in popularity about 1900. The atmospheric, unfocused imagery of Symbolist poetry eventually came to be seen as overrefined and affected, and the term décadent, which the Symbolists had once proudly flaunted, became with others a term of derision denoting mere fin-de-siècle preciosity. Symbolist works had a strong and lasting influence on much British and American literature in the 20th century, however. Their experimental techniques greatly enriched the technical repertoire of modern poetry. 
</p>

<h3 class="centertext">Fauvism  (1905 - 1910)</h3>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Fauvism.jpg" class="artt" alt="Fauvism" style="float:left;width:130px;height:100px;">

<p>
Fauvism was a joyful style of painting that delighted in using outrageously bold colors. It was developed in France at the beginning of the 20th century by Henri Matisse and André Derain. The artists who painted in this style were known as 'Les Fauves' (the wild beasts), a title that came from a sarcastic remark in a review by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles.
</p>

<p>
'Les Fauves' believed that color should be used at its highest pitch to express the artist's feelings about a subject, rather than simply to describe what it looks like. Fauvist paintings have two main characteristics: extremely simplified drawing and intensely exaggerated color. Fauvism was a major influence on German Expressionism.
</p>

<hr>

<h3 class="centertext">Expressionism (1905 - 1920)</h3>

<p>
Expressionism emerged simultaneously in various cities across Germany as a response to a widespread anxiety about humanity's increasingly discordant relationship with the world and accompanying lost feelings of authenticity and spirituality. In part a reaction against Impressionism and academic art, Expressionism was inspired most heavily by the Symbolist currents in late-19th-century art. Vincent van Gogh, Edvard Munch, and James Ensor proved particularly influential to the Expressionists, encouraging the distortion of form and the deployment of strong colors to convey a variety of anxieties and yearnings.
</p>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Wheatfield%20with%20Crows.jpg" class="artt" alt="Wheatfield with Crows" style="float:right;width:130px;height:140px;">

<p>
Twentieth century expressionism in Germany emerged during the mid-1900s in Dresden and Munich. A parallel but smaller movement sprang up in Austria at about the same time. Broadly speaking, up until the beginning of World War I, the expressionist movement in Germany remained an aesthetic development of the Saxon Worpswede Group and the Parisian Fauvist movement. It was also influenced by Van Gogh's pioneering expressionist paintings like Wheatfield with Crows, and Starry Night. Unlike Impressionists, who sought merely to imitate nature, German expressionist painters typically distorted colour, scale and space to convey their subjective feelings about what they saw. However, war scarred many of these artists for good. As a result, from 1915 onwards, German expressionism became a bitter protest movement as well as a style of modern art. The centre for much of this avant-garde art was Sturm Gallery, in Berlin.
</p>

<p>
Die Neue Sachlichkeit was a German art group centred in Berlin, that group explored a new form of realism with a socialist flavour. Vividly satirical in its portrayal of corruption in wartime and postwar Weimar Germany, its leading members included: George Grosz, Otto Dix, Max Beckmann, and Christian Schad. Many groups like this one in Germany grew and cultivated this art movement, influencing other art movements later.
</p>

<h3 class="centertext">Cubism (1907 - 1915)</h3>

<p>
If pushed, most art historians would say that the movement known as Cubism began in 1907 with Picasso's picture Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. This work signalled the start of an exploratory phase, during which Picasso and Georges Braque came together to establish a number of new and important principles of modern art.  It wasn't until 1908 that both artists formed the intimate working relationship based on the ideas of Paul Cezanne, expressed in his masterpiece The Large Bathers, which led to the invention of first Analytical Cubism and later  Synthetic Cubism. 
</p>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Cubism.jpg" class="artt" alt="Cubism" style="float:right;width:130px;height:100px;">

<p>
The Cubist painters rejected the inherited concept that art should copy nature, or that artists should adopt the traditional techniques of perspective, modeling, and foreshortening. They wanted instead to emphasize the two-dimensionality of the canvas. So they reduced and fractured objects into geometric forms, and then realigned these within a shallow, relieflike space. They also used multiple or contrasting vantage points.
</p>

<p>
Although figures and objects were dissected or “analyzed” into a multitude of small facets, these were then reassembled, after a fashion, to evoke those same figures or objects. During Analytic Cubism, also called “hermetic,” Picasso and Braque so abstracted their works that they were reduced to just a series of overlapping planes and facets mostly in near-monochromatic browns, grays, or blacks. In their work from this period, Picasso and Braque frequently combined representational motifs with letters. 
</p>

<img src="Modern%20Art/cubist%20sculpture.jpg" class="artt" alt="cubist sculpture" style="float:right;width:130px;height:120px;">

<p>
While Picasso and Braque are credited with creating this new visual language, it was adopted and further developed by many painters, including Fernand Léger, Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Juan Gris and even Diego Rivera. Though primarily associated with painting, Cubism also exerted a profound influence on twentieth-century sculpture and architecture. The major Cubist sculptors were Alexander Archipenko, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, and Jacques Lipchitz. The liberating formal concepts initiated by Cubism also had far-reaching consequences for Dada and Surrealism, as well as for all artists pursuing abstraction in Germany, Holland, Italy, England, America, and Russia.
</p>

<p>
World War I effectively halted Cubism as an organized movement, with a number of artists, including Braque, Lhote, de la Fresnaye and Léger, getting called up for duty. By 1917, Picasso returned his practice of injecting more realism into his paintings, though his refusal to be pinned down meant Cubism reappeared in some works over the years. Braque continued his experimentation. His further work featured elements of Cubism, though noted for less rigidity in the abstractions of the subjects. Though Cubism never regained its place as an organized force in the art world, its vast influence has continued in art movements like Futurism, Constructivism, Abstract Expressionism, and others.
</p>

<hr>

<h3 class="centertext">Futurism (1909 - 1914)</h3>

<img src="Modern%20Art/futurism.jpg" class="artt" alt="futurism" style="float:right;width:130px;height:150px;">

<p>
Futurism was an avant-garde art movement which was launched in Italy, in 1909, although parallel movements arose in Russia, England and elsewhere. It was one of the first important modern art movements not centered in Paris. Futurism exalted the dynamism of the modern world, especially its science and technology. Futurist ideology influenced all types of art. It began in literature but spread to every medium, including painting, sculpture, industrial design, architecture, cinema and music. However, most of its major exponents were painters and the movement produced several important 20th century paintings. It ceased to be an aesthetic force in 1915, shortly after the start of the First World War, but lingered in Italy until the 1930s. The Futurist Painting: Technical Manifesto by Umberto Boccioni was the first exposition of the theoretical underpinnings of Italian Futurist painting.
</p>

<p>
To begin with they borrowed the methods of Neo-Impressionism. In which forms are broken down into dots and stripes capable of depicting the glitter of light or the blur of high speed movement.
Futurist art was first exhibited at a show of modern art in Milan in 1911. The first purely Futurist show was in early 1912 at the Galerie Berhein-Jeune in Paris. The show then travelled to the highly influential Sturm Gallery Berlin, founded by Herwarth Walden, and afterwards to Amsterdam, Zurich and Vienna, generating widespread publicity for the movement, thanks largely to Marinetti's promotional flair. painters were influenced by Italian Divisionism and the paintings of Vittore Grubicy De Dragon and fell under the influence of analytical Cubism. Often, Cubist techniques would be combined with urban and political subject matter, often on a large scale and Futurist works were relatively static.
</p>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Italian%20Futurism.jpg" class="artt" alt="Italian Futurism"  style="float:left;width:130px;height:100px">

<p>
Italian Futurism had a visible impact on artists across Europe. Futurism also influenced the Vorticists in Britain, the Dada movement in Zurich and Berlin, Art Deco, American Precisionism, and Surrealism. In Russia, Futurism had a strong effect on Rayonism and Constructivism. The movement endured longer in Russia, becoming closely associated with revolutionary politics, and influenced several other Russian art movements.
</p>

<p>
By 1914, Italian Futurism was in decline. Personal rifts and artistic disagreements between the Milan group. After the defeat of Mussolini and Marinetti's death in 1944, Futurism as a formal movement was dead. After the brutality of the first world war, many artists rejected the avant-garde notions of futurism and other pre-war movements, by using more traditional and reassuring approaches, a phenomenon described as the 'return to order'. However, it remained highly influential for subsequent 20th-century art movements like Dada and Surrealism.

<h3 class="centertext">Dada (1916 - 1924)</h3>

<p>
Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century. For Dada artists, the aesthetic of their work was considered secondary to the ideas it conveyed. Dadaists both embraced and critiqued modernity, imbuing their works with references to the technologies, newspapers, films, and advertisements that increasingly defined contemporary life. Using unorthodox materials and chance-based procedures, they infused their work with spontaneity and irreverence. Wielding scissors and glue, Dada artists innovated with collage and photomontage.
The founder of dada was a writer, Hugo Ball. Dada emerged amid the brutality of World War I, a conflict that claimed the lives of eight million military personnel and an estimated equal number of civilians. This unprecedented loss of human life was a result of trench warfare and technological advances in weaponry, communications, and transportation systems. Dada artists felt the war called into question every aspect of a society capable of starting and then prolonging it. Their aim was to destroy traditional values in art and to create a new art to replace the old.
</p>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Dada.jpg" class="artt" alt="Dada" style="float:right;width:130px;height:150px;">

<p>
Irreverence was a crucial component of Dada art, whether it was a lack of respect for bourgeois convention, government authorities, conventional production methods, or the artistic canon. Each group varied slightly in their focus, with the Berlin group being the most anti-government and the New York group being the most anti-art. Of all the groups, the Hannover group was likely the most conservative.
Humor, typically in the form of irony, was closely related to Dada. In fact, the embrace of the readymade is key to Dada's use of irony as it shows an awareness that nothing has intrinsic value. Irony also gave the artists flexibility and expressed their embrace of the craziness of the world thus preventing them from taking their work too seriously or from getting caught up in excessive enthusiasm or dreams of utopia. Their humor is an unequivocal YES to everything as art.
</p>

<p>
Many of the artists joined other art movements - in particular Surrealism. In fact, Dada's tradition of irrationality and chance led directly to the Surrealist love for fantasy and expression of the imaginary. Dada, the direct antecedent to the Conceptual Art movement, is now considered a watershed moment in 20th-century art. Postmodernism as we know it would not exist without Dada. Almost every underlying postmodern theory in visual and written art as well as in music and drama was invented or at least utilized by Dada artists: art as performance, the overlapping of art with everyday life, the use of popular culture, audience participation, the interest in non-Western forms of art, the embrace of the absurd, and the use of chance. A large number of artistic movements since Dada can trace their influence to the anti-establishment group. 
Art movements like Surrealism, Neo-Dada, Conceptual art, Pop art, Fluxus, Situationist International, Performance art, Feminist art, and Minimalism were all influenced by Dada. Dada also had a profound influence on graphic design and the field of advertising with their use of collage.

<h3 class="centertext">Suprematism (1916 - 1935)</h3>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Suprematist%20Composition.jpg" class="artt" alt="Suprematist composition" style="float:right;width:130px;height:150px;">

<p>
Suprematism was developed in 1915 by the Russian artist Kazimir Malevich. It was a geometric style of abstract painting derived from elements of Cubism and Futurism. Malevich rejected any use of representational images, believing that the non-representational forms of pure abstraction had a greater spiritual power and an ability to open the mind to ‘the supremacy of pure feeling’. Suprematism was a style of pure abstraction that advocated a mystical approach to art, in contrast with Constructivism, the major Russian art movement of the 20th Century, whose imagery served the social and political ideology of the state.
The Suprematists' interest in abstraction was fired by a search for the 'zero degree' of painting, the point beyond which the medium could not go without ceasing to be art. This encouraged the use of very simple motifs, since they best articulated the shape and flat surface of the canvases on which they were painted. (Ultimately, the square, circle, and cross became the group's favorite motifs.) It also encouraged many Suprematists to emphasize the surface texture of the paint on canvas, this texture being another essential quality of the medium of painting.
</p>

<p>
Though much Suprematist art can seem highly austere and serious, there was a strong tone of absurdism running through the movement. One of Malevich's initial inspirations for the movement was zaum, or transrational poetry, of some of his contemporaries, something that led him to the idea of zaum painting.
The Russian Formalists, an important and highly influential group of literary critics, who were Malevich's contemporaries, were opposed to the idea that language is a simple, transparent vehicle for communication. They pointed out that words weren't so easily linked to the objects they denoted. This fostered the idea that art could serve to make the world fresh and strange, art could make us look at the world in new ways. Suprematist abstract painting was aimed at doing much the same, by removing the real world entirely and leaving the viewer to contemplate what kind of picture of the world is offered.
</p>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Suprematism.jpg" class="artt" alt="Suprematism" style="float:right;width:130px;height:150px;">

<p>
The culmination of Suprematism can be seen in the white stage, exhibited by Malevich during the Tenth State Exhibition: Non-objective Creation and Suprematism in 1919. His masterpiece, White on White, dispensed with form entirely, representing only "the idea." This work provoked responses from other artists that led to new ventures, such as Alexander Rodchenko's Constructivist exploration of the roles of specific materials in his Black on Black series. As time went on, the movement's spiritual undertones increasingly defined it, and although these put it in jeopardy following the Russian Revolution of 1917, the tolerant attitude of the early Communists ensured that its influence continued. By the late 1920s, however, attitudes had changed, and the movement lost much of its popularity at home, especially after being condemned by the Stalinists, Socialist Realism became the only allowed style.
The introduction of Suprematism to the West during a 1927 Berlin exhibition was well-received, sparking interest throughout Europe and the United States. Alfred Barr later brought several of Malevich's Suprematist works to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, a groundbreaking exhibition that greatly influenced American modernism. Lissitzky played a key role in the promotion of Suprematism outside of Russia, having previously exhibited Proun works that left a deep impression on László Moholy-Nagy, and possibly even Kandinsky. El Lissitzky later used Suprematist forms and concepts to great effect in graphic design and architecture, which helped to shape the Constructionist movement. Today, these echoes are still seen in contemporary architecture, most famously in the recent "Suprematist" work of Zaha Hadid.
</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="centertext">Abstract Expressionism (1943 - 1965)</h3>

<p>
"Abstract Expressionism" was never an ideal label for the movement, which developed in New York in the 1940s and 1950s. It was somehow meant to encompass not only the work of painters who filled their canvases with fields of color and abstract forms, but also those who attacked their canvases with a vigorous gestural expressionism. Still Abstract Expressionism has become the most accepted term for a group of artists who held much in common. All were committed to art as expressions of the self, born out of profound emotion and universal themes, and most were shaped by the legacy of Surrealism, a movement that they translated into a new style fitted to the post-war mood of anxiety and trauma. In their success, these New York painters robbed Paris of its mantle as leader of modern art, and set the stage for America's dominance of the international art world.
</p>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Autumn%20Rhythm.jpg" class="artt" alt="Autumn Rhythm" style="float:right;width:130px;height:150px;">

<p>
Political instability in Europe in the 1930s brought several leading Surrealists to New York, and many of the Abstract Expressionists were profoundly influenced by Surrealism's focus on mining the unconscious. It encouraged their interest in myth and archetypal symbols and it shaped their understanding of painting itself as a struggle between self-expression and the chaos of the subconscious. Abstract Expressionism artists nced by the era's leftist politics, and came to value an art grounded in personal experience. Few would maintain their earlier radical political views, but many continued to adopt the posture of outspoken avant-gardists.
America suffered economically and felt culturally isolated and provincial, the Abstract Expressionists were later welcomed as the first authentically American avant-garde. Their art was championed for being emphatically American in spirit - monumental in scale, romantic in mood, and expressive of a rugged individual freedom. The experience of working for the government-sponsored Works Progress Administration also brought many disparate figures together, and this would make it easier for them to band together again in the late 1940s and early 1950s when the new style was being promoted.
</p>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Mountains%20and%20Sea.jpg" class="artt" alt="Mountains and Sea" style="float:left;width:130px;height:150px;">

<p>
The Abstract Expressionist movement of 1950s New York would make a huge impact on the art world and bloom outward to influence a second generation of Abstract Expressionist artists with slightly different concerns. These artists were more diverse in terms of gender, socio-cultural environment, and geography although a key hub did emerge in San Francisco. Greenberg coined these followers of a decidedly de Kooning style, those who painted with a "tenth street touch," or loaded brush. Unlike their forebears, the second-generation artists' emphasis shifted from the interior, subjective world to the objective exterior - analyzing and questioning what gave things meaning. Greenberg staged a show in 1964 called "Post-Painterly Abstraction" to showcase these new styles, which had arisen from the influence of Abstract Expressionism and showcased this new generation of talent. Lyrical Abstraction and Hard Edge would also emerge during this time. Second Generation Abstract Expressionists included Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, Joan Mitchell, and many others.
</p>

<p>
By the mid 1950s the style had also run its course in other ways. The movement's greatest achievements were often built on a conflict between chaos and control. which could only be played out in so many ways. Some artists, such as Newman and Rothko, had evolved a style so reductive that there was little room for development - and to change course would have shrunk the grandeur of their bold trademarks.
By the late 1950s, Abstract Expressionism had entirely lost its place at the center of critical debate and a new generation was on the cusp of success. Yet the legacy of the movement was to be considerable. Allan Kaprow sensed this as early as 1958 when he wrote an article for ART News entitled "What is the legacy of Jackson Pollock?" His answer pointed beyond painting, and Pollock's influence was certainly felt in areas where performance had a role: he was to be important to the Japanese Gutai movement as well as the Viennese Actionists. But the influence of the movement as a whole would continue to be felt by painters maturing in subsequent decades. It was important for the likes of Dorothea Rockburne, Pat Steir, Susan Rothenberg and Jack Whitten in the 1970s. Its rhetoric - if not its direct example - would be important for many Neo-Expressionists in the 1980s such as Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. And in the 1990s it again provided an example to painters such as Cecily Brown. The themes and concepts that informed Abstract Expressionism may have lost the power to compel young artists, but the movement's achievements continue to supply them with standards against which to be measured.
</p>

<h3 class="centertext">Pop Art (1950 - 1970)</h3>

<img src="Modern%20Art/Campbell's%20Soup%20Cans.jpg" class="artt" alt="Campbell's Soup Cans" style="float:right;width:130px;height:150px;">

<p>
Pop Art's refreshing reintroduction of identifiable imagery, drawn from media and popular culture, was a major shift for the direction of modernism. With roots in Neo-Dada and other movements that questioned the very definition of “art” itself, Pop was birthed in the United Kingdom in the 1950s amidst a postwar socio-political climate where artists turned toward celebrating commonplace objects and elevating the everyday to the level of fine art. American artists Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist and others would soon follow suit to become the most famous champions of the movement in their own rejection of traditional historic artistic subject matter in lieu of contemporary society’s ever-present infiltration of mass manufactured products and images that dominated the visual realm. Perhaps owing to the incorporation of commercial images, Pop Art has become one of the most recognizable styles of modern art. Although artists in the Independent Group in London initiated the use of "pop" in reference to art, American artists soon followed suit and incorporated popular culture into their artwork as well. Although the individual styles vary widely, all of the artists maintain a commonality in their choice of popular culture imagery as their fundamental subject. Shortly after American Pop Art arrived on the art world scene, mainland European variants developed in the Capitalist Realist movement in Germany and the Nouveau Réalisme movement in France.
By creating paintings or sculptures of mass culture objects and media stars, the Pop Art movement aimed to blur the boundaries between "high" art and "low" culture. The concept that there is no hierarchy of culture and that art may borrow from any source has been one of the most influential characteristics of Pop Art. Although Pop Art encompasses a wide variety of work with very different attitudes and postures, much of it is somewhat emotionally removed. Pop artists seemingly embraced the post-World War II manufacturing and media boom. Some critics have cited the Pop Art choice of imagery as an enthusiastic endorsement of the capitalist market and the goods it circulated, while others have noted an element of cultural critique in the Pop artists' elevation of the everyday to high art, ying the commodity status of the goods represented to the status of the art object itself, emphasizing art's place as, at base, a commodity.
</p>

<p>
The Pop Art collages of Paolozzi and Hamilton convey the mixed feelings Europeans maintained toward American popular culture; both exalting the mass-produced objects and images while also criticizing the excess. The members of the Independent Group were the first artists to present mass media imagery, acknowledging the challenges to traditional art categories occurring in America and Britain after 1945. In addition to using the imagery from these mass-produced picture books, Roy Lichtenstein appropriated the techniques used to create the images in comic books to create his paintings. He not only adopted the same bright colors and clear outlines as popular art, his most innovative contribution was his use of Ben-Day dots. By hand-painting the usually machine-generated dots, and recreating comic book scenes, Lichtenstein blurred the distinction between mass reproduction and high art.
Andy Warhol is most famous for his vividly colored portraits of celebrities. His earliest works depict objects like Coca-Cola bottles and Campbell's soup cans, reproduced ad infinitum, as if the gallery wall were a shelf in a supermarket. Warhol transitioned from hand painting to screenprinting to further facilitate the large-scale replication of pop images. Warhol's insistence on mechanical reproduction rejected notions of artistic authenticity and genius. Instead, he acknowledged the commodification of art, proving that paintings were no different from cans of Campbell's soup; both have material worth and could be bought and sold like consumer goods. He further equated the mass-produced status of consumer goods with that of celebrities in portraits like Marilyn Diptych

In Germany, the counterpart to the American Pop Art movement was Capitalist Realism, a movement that focused on subjects taken from commodity culture and utilized an aesthetic based in the mass media. Capitalist Realism sought to expose the consumerism and superficiality of contemporary capitalist society by using the imagery and aesthetic of popular art and advertising within their work. In France, aspects of Pop Art were present in Nouveau Réalisme, a movement launched by the critic Pierre Restany in 1960, with the drafting of the "Constitutive Declaration of New Realism," that proclaimed, "Nouveau Réalisme - new ways of perceiving the real." While the movement echoed the American Pop artists' concerns with commercial culture, many of the Nouveau Réalistes were more concerned with objects than with painting, as is the case with Spoerri, whose "snare-pictures" used food, cutlery, and tabletops as artistic media. Other key proponents of the movement included Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely, Arman, François Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Niki de Saint Phalle, and Christo and Jean-Claude.

Emerging in a coherent form in New York, during the 1960s, Minimal art, popularly known as Minimalism, is a  style of abstract painting or sculpture characterized by extreme simplicity of form and using a type of visual art reduced to the essentials of geometric abstraction. Minimalism derives from the minimal geometric forms of the Suprematist painting Kasimir Malevich in works like Black Circle. As it was, the emergence of Minimalism was as much a reaction against the emotionalism of Abstract Expressionism as a culmination of a particular aesthetic. One of the first abstract painters to be specifically linked with Minimalism was the Abstract Expressionist. Minimalist paintings and sculptures are generally composed of precise, hard-edged, geometric forms, with rigid planes of colour pigment. 
Artists who became Minimalists wanted instead to produce an art that was less personal and more substantial, believing that a work of art should not refer to anything other than itself. Thus by the early 1960s, many of these artists had abandoned painting altogether in favor of objects that seemed neither painting nor sculpture in the conventional sense. Minimalist works were dependent on the context and conditions in which they were perceived.

The use of fluorescent light tubes to create art further emphasized the Minimalist move away from traditional art forms. Dan Flavin used light and color from commercially available tubes to sculpt space into color zones. While the tubes were sometimes arranged in geometric shapes such as grids or simple lines, the focus of the art was typically on the light emitted rather than the form of the tubes themselves. The standard industrial fixtures that held the tubes were also useful as compositional elements. Turned to the viewer, their blank sides contrasted to the outward facing colored light in the grid pieces. Younger artists Keith Sonnier and Bruce Nauman saw the potential of light in sculpture and used neon tubing in combination with other materials and lettering.
By the late 1960s, just a few years after the movement was born, Minimalism was diversifying into many disciplines to such an extent that it could no longer be seen as a coherent style or tendency: various artists who had been important to its early development began to move in different personal directions. New ideas and styles quickly came to dominate the emerging world. Detractors of Minimalist art were led by Michael Fried, whose essay "Art and Objecthood" was published in Artforum in 1967. Although the essay seemed to confirm the importance of the movement as a turning point in the history of modern art. This was a clear break in art eras where in Modern art the substance of the artwork was prioritized but now in current contemporary art the style of the artist takes precedence over whatever the artwork and artist was communicating making minimalism the last art movement in the modern art period.
