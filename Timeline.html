<h3 class="fontclass">Pop Art (1950s–1960s)
</h3>
<p>Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s. One of its aims is to use images of popular (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. The Pop art movement aimed to solidify the idea that art can draw from any source, and there is no hierarchy of culture to disrupt this.</p>
<p>
Pop art is important because it sought to connect fine art with the masses and involved using imagery that ordinary people could recognize and relate to, showing people can draw art from everyday life. Pop art used parody and irony in an attempt to subvert capitalism. The movement had socio-political implications that are still being realized today! In this regard, pop art could be considered more of a cultural movement or a social movement.
</p>
<p>
Pop art was the first movement to declare the reality that advertising and commercial endeavor were actually forms of art. With the advent of pop art, trends and fashions become subsumed into an all-encompassing phenomena that seeks to merge the whole cultural endeavor into a singular aesthetic style. Pop art suggests advertisement is another form of art which does promote a product for the purpose of building interest around it.  You can see the impact on marketing, advertising and  branding became influenced by pop art and pop art had originally drawn influence from them.

<h3 class="fontclass">Conceptual Art (1960s–1970s)
</h3>
<p>Conceptual Art is all about "ideas and meanings" rather than "works of art" (paintings, sculptures, other precious objects). It is characterized by its use of text, as well as imagery, along with a variety of ephemeral, typically everyday materials and "found objects".</p>
<p>In seeking to convey a semantic representation through a vehicular medium, conceptual art arguably aims to have cognitive – rather than aesthetic – value. By cognitive value, what is meant is simply the value an artwork may have in virtue of enhancing or increasing our understanding of some topic, notion or event. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair.</p>
